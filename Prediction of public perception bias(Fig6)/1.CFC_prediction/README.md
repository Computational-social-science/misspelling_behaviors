# File Descriptions of the CFC Automation Program Stages

### 1. `words.txt`
- This file is generated by the signal-to-noise ratio modeling automation and contains the original spelling variants of all words along with the original data starting points.

### 2. `data_new.txt`
- This file contains the updated data after adjusting the data starting points in the signal-to-noise ratio modeling automation code. The format is the same as `words.txt`.

### 3. `peak_values.txt`
- This file records the Bayesian bootstrap range of the actual time series data. The record format has three types:
  1. `{sheet_name} {number} {first_peak_index+number} {first_valley_index+number}`
  2. `{sheet_name} {number} {first_peak_index+number} {peak_index[1]+number}`
  3. `{sheet_name} {number} 2019`
  
  In this case, `ps` refers to:
  - `number` (the starting point from `data_new`)
  - `peak_index[1]+number` (the second peak)

### 4. `cfc.txt`
- This file records the mutation points of the actual time series data calculated by the Bayesian bootstrap. The format is:
  - `correct_spelling` + " " + `mutation_point`

### 5. `peak_values_predict.txt`
- This file records the Bayesian bootstrap range of the predicted data.

### 6. `cfc_predict.txt`
- This file records the mutation points of the predicted data.
